    "This part of the interview is about discussing how you approach data analysis. Below we describe some sample data which could be used to construct price indexes. Our goal is to construct a dataset that contains how the price of *unique* items has changed over time. We have the following concerns\n",
    "   * We don't want prices to change because of changes in items (e.g. a new model of iPhone)\n",
    "   * We want the price changes we use to be representative\n",
    "We don't expect you to have all the answers. We just want to discuss what sorts of things come to your mind and how you approach this problem. Let us know what you are thinking and what steps you would take. "
